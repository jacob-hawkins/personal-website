This is a clone of the Twitter login system meant as a Phishing attack aimed to gain access to the victims twitter account without their knowledge. The victim is prompted to input their username and password and in completion would be redirected back to the real Twitter login page, perhaps causing them to think the login failed and would try again. This demo only alerts the user their username and password and does nothing more.",
